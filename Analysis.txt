"" Big O Notation ""

""contants were dropped and the notation has been simplified.""

Task0.py = O(1)
-> two print statements that run only one time

Task1.py = O(n)
-> two for loop, which is the interation. since I changed 'containtment' to 'add', now it should be O(n). 


Task2.py = O(n^2)
-> two for loop and 1 loop has containtment inside, therefore, it should be O(n^2)

Taks3.py -> Part 1 = O(n + nlogn), Part 2 = O(n^3 + n^2)

Part1 -> two for loop with add function, also, it has sorted function at the end, therefore, O(n + nlogn)
Part2 -> one for loop has find, which I believe check function so it's n^2, the other loop has the check and interation insider so it's n^3.


Taks4.py = O(n + nlogn)
-> three for loop with each has add & dicard funtion, and it has sort function at the end, therefor, O(n + nlogn)
